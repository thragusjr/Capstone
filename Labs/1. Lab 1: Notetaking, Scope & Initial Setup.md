- ## Introduction
	- Name
	- Introductory Pentesting
- ## Disclaimer
	- These labs are strictly for educations purposes. These techniques are not to be used outside of this lab, or in an otherwise authorized environment.
	- If you use these techniques in situations where you don't have permission, you could very well end up in a different kind of college. Con college. Please don't.
- ## Notetaking
	- Effective notetaking is very important for this lab and pentesting in general.
	- We will be dealing with a huge amount of information in this lab, so please find notetaking tools and techniques that work for you.
	- Tools that I use:
		- For quick copy and pasting, I typically have Notepad, Geany or Notepad++ open.
		- A great notetaking tool included with Kali is CherryTree. Cherry Tree can be used for more complex notes
			- Cherry Tree allows you to:
				- Create "notebook" style folders called "nodes"
				- Attack links to files, folders and images in your notes
				- Create templates to use in future notes
- ## The Importance of Keep Track Of, and Staying Within Scope
	- Spreadsheet or something to keep up with what you've covered and what we still have left
- ## Researching Vulnerabilities
	- To be effective with the tools in this lab, we must have an understanding of vulnerabilities existing in the services we test.
	- Vulnerability Databases and Information:
		- [Exploit-DB / Exploits + Shellcode + GHDB Â· GitLab](https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb)
		- [Overview | CVE](https://www.cve.org/About/Overview)
		- [Exploit Database Search](https://www.exploit-db.com/search)
		- [CVE Security Vulnerability Database](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
	- How To's & More
		- [CVSS v3.1 User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide)
		- [CVSS v3.1 Examples](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/examples)
		- [National Vulnerability Database - Home](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- ## Double Check Your VMs.
	- Ensure your Kali Machine can connect to Metasploitable2
	- Use ping to confirm there is no packet loss
		- From Metasploitable2:
			- ping <Kali_IP>
		- From Kali terminal:
			- ping <metasploitable2_IP>
- ## Organize Your Files
	- Make a folder within your documents folder that will house your scan files. Call it the IP of the target VM, metasploitable2 - anything you'd like. It will help organize your scans so they aren't all over the place. 
- ## Setting Up **Faraday**
	- To help with reporting and keeping track of our lab information, we will be using a tool called Faraday.
	- With Faraday, we can output the results of a number of our scans and automatically log and organize the vulnerabilities we find.
	- **Create Faraday Workspace**
		- faraday -h
		- Faraday will give you credentials to sign in to your local Faraday server.
		- Once logged in to the server, create a workspace and a host for Metasploitable2.
		- Please refer to the Faraday tool file if you have any questions.
