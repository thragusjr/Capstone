- #### **Introduction
	- These labs were written by Ethan Page for his Cybersecurity Degree Capstone Project. 
	- The labs are intended for The Husky Hackers club and The University of Southern Maine's ITT 413: Ethical Hacking Class.
	- Only those intended recepients have permission to draw from and/or alter these labs as they see fit.
- #### Disclaimer
	- These labs are strictly for educations purposes. These techniques are not to be used outside of this lab, or in an otherwise authorized environment.
	- If you use these techniques in situations where you don't have permission, there are very real, very criminal consequences. 
	- Please use these labs legally, ethically and responsibly. Enjoy.

# Lab 1: Notetaking, Scope & Initial Setup

- ## Notetaking
	- Effective notetaking is very important for this lab and pentesting in general.
	- We will be dealing with a huge amount of information in this lab, so please find notetaking tools and techniques that work for you.
	- Recommended Tools:
		- For quick copy and pasting, I typically have Notepad, Geany or Notepad++ open.
		- A great notetaking tool included with Kali is CherryTree. Cherry Tree can be used for much more comprehensive notetaking.
			- Cherry Tree allows you to:
				- Create "notebook" style folders called "nodes"
				- Attack links to files, folders and images in your notes
				- Create templates to use in future notes

- ## The Importance of Scope
	- When conducting a penetration test, we are typically given something called a scope. Scope is the environment(s) in which we are permitted to conduct our testing. 
	- Whether that is a network, a list of workstations, or a range of IP's, we want to ensure that what we are always within the bounds of scope. 
	- Scope is what distinguishes a penetration test from illegal and/or unethical activity. 
	- For the purposes of these labs, **your scope will be the Metasploitable2 workstation and web server, and the hackthissite website. 
	- Whether you keep track of scope in Cherry Tree, notepad or Faraday, it's very important to do so. 
- ## Researching Vulnerabilities
	- To reach the full potential of the tools covered in this lab, we must have an understanding of existing vulnerabilities.
	- Listed below are some excellent resources to help you keep up with, and gain a better understanding of vulnerabilities within the services we test.

		- [National Vulnerability Database - Home](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- ## VM Setup
	- Double check your Kali Machine can connect to Metasploitable2
	- Use ping to confirm there is no packet loss
		- From Metasploitable2:
			- ping <Kali_IP>
		- From Kali terminal:
			- ping <metasploitable2_IP>
- ## Setting Up **Faraday**
	-   To help with reporting and keeping track of our lab information, we will be using a tool called Faraday.
	-   With Faraday, we can output the results of a number of scans to automatically log and organize vulnerabilities we find in these labs.
	-   **Create Faraday Workspace**
	    -   Type the following in your terminal:
	        -   faraday -h
	        -   From here, Faraday will provide credentials for access to your local Faraday server.
	    -   Once logged in to the server, create a workspace and a host for Metasploitable2.
	    -   Please refer to the Faraday tool file if you have any questions.
	- **Once finished, please move on to Lab 2**
