# Overview:
- This lab will cover the reconnaissance step of the pentest process.
- Reconnaissance is when we gather as much useful data as possible on a target
- The IP numbers shown in these labs are likely not the ones you need to use. Please swap those out accordingly.

# **Initial Reconnaissance**
- ### **Useful Commands for Reconnaissance**
- The following commands do not specifically pertain to these labs, but they are good to practice nontheless. Especially if you are interested in Bug Bounties or Web App Pentests.

	- host *URL*
	- nslookup *URL*
	- traceroute *URL*
		- **-p**Â _port_
	- dig -t ns *URL*

- ### **Online Resources**
