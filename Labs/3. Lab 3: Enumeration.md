# Overview
- Enumeration is when dig into the items we found in information gathering to see if we can find anything of value.
- We research on potential weak points. 
- If we find information on a service, we go out and research vulnerabilties in that service.
- Remember to substitute the IP addreses with the ones you need to use.

# Enumeration Tools & Techniques

## Nmap Active Scan
- **Important Flags We Will/Can Use To Enumerate With Nmap**
	- sC - default script
	- sV - version information
	- A - All/aggressive
	- O - operating system information
	- oX - output to XML (allows for import directly into Faraday)
- **Scan**
	- **Standard Scan example**
		- nmap -sS 172.21.10.0
- **Scan for Nmap** 
		- **Tailored script --interrogate for service version info --interrogate for OS info --output to XML**
				- nmap -sC -sV -O -oX
				- tr ',' '\n' < file.txt | grep -i open > matches.txt
- **We can send ports directly to Nikto for additional scanning if we'd like** 
		- Nmap port 80 - IP  
			- nmap -p80 10.0.1.0/24 -oG - | nikto.pl -h -

## **Nikto**
- **Nikto** is a vulnerability scanner that can be used on both hostnames and specific URLs
- **To perform a default scan with Nikto, use the following template:**
			- nikto -h "IP address" or nikto --url "domain"
		- **To scan a host-specific port range**
			- nikto -host [host IP/name] -port [port number 1], [port number 2], [port number 3]
		- **Scan and output information to a specific file**
			- nikto -host [host IP/name] -output [output_file]
- For the purposes of this lab, type the following into your terminals:
	- Nitko -h 192.168.9.239 -output /home/user/Documents/nikto_scan.txt

## Enumerating MySql with sqlmap
- **SqlMap** is a tool used for the enumeration and exploitation of databases.
	- Check out the full functionality of SqlMap using 'sqlmap -h' in your terminal.
- **Flags we will use**:
	- **-d** - this flag specifies we are connecting to a database.
	- **-f** - tells SqlMap to use fingerprint mode.
	- **--banner** - tells SqlMap to attempt to obtain database service information.
	- **--dbs** - indicates that we want SqlMap to try to obtain information on specific databases.
	- **--output-dir=** - tells SqlMap where we want the file to go.
- To enumerate our found MySql database with SqlMap, type the folling into your terminal:
	- sqlmap -d "mysql://root:@192.168.9.239:3306/" -f --banner --dbs --output-dir=/home/user/Documents/

## WordLists
- Wordlists are lists of string values that include common usernames, passwords and more.
- Check out the FOSS Linux article on wordlists below:
	- [Kali Linux Wordlist - What you need to know | FOSS Linux](https://www.fosslinux.com/48115/kali-linux-wordlist-what-you-need-to-know.htm)
- All wordlists in Kali are located at /usr/share/wordlists/
- In your terminal you can view information on the worldlists tool by typing:
	- wordlists -h
- **secLists** is a particulary great collection as it strives to find and gather the all of the useful wordlists.
- We will be using wordlists for several steps in our labs, including subdirectory enumeration, fuzzing and more.

## Subdirectory Enumeration with Gobuster
- In your Kali terminal:
	- gobuster -h
- **Flags We Will Use**
	- u - URL
	- w - worlist
	- o - output file
- In your Kali terminal:
	- gobuster dir -u https://192.168.9.239/ w <subdomains-top-5000> -o /home/user/Documents/gobusterScan.txt

## **Fuzzing with wFuzz**
- Look at payloads
	- wfuzz -e payloads
- Subdomain Fuzzing With Wordlist
	- wfuzz -c -Z -w subdomains.txt http://FUZZ.vulnweb.com
- Directory Fuzzing With Wordlist:
	- wfuzz -w wordlist/general/common.txt http://testphp.vulnweb.com/FUZZ
