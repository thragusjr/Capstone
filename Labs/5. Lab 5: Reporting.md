# Lab 5: Reporting

-   Decent hackers are a dime a dozen. Great report writing makes you stand out in a crowd.
-   Use this lab and examples from the freely available pentest reports to **write a report with your results from the previous labs**.

## **Considerations When Writing a Report**
- **Use a Technical Writing Approach**
	- Write in the 3rd Person.
- **Explain on a Level a Client Can Understand**
	- The individuals reviewing this document may not have extensive cybersecurity expertise. This is not an ELI5, but its should not be overly complex either.
## **Items to Cover in a Pentest Report:**
- **Data and Name of Tester**
- **CVE: Vulnerability Name & Categorization**
	- Use the resources mentioned in lab one to determine this information:
		- [Exploit-DB / Exploits + Shellcode + GHDB Â· GitLab](https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb)

		- [Exploit Database Search](https://www.exploit-db.com/search)
		- [CVE Security Vulnerability Database](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
	- Version(s) of Associated Services.
		- If a vulnerability is found in a workstation using Windows 7, make sure to include that.
- **CVSS Score: Severity**
	- [CVSS v3.1 User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide)
